`quickcheck-state-machine` is a Haskell library, based
on [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), for testing
stateful programs. The library is different from
the
[`Test.QuickCheck.Monadic`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck/docs/Test-QuickCheck-Monadic.html) approach
in that it lets the user specify the correctness by means of a state machine
based model using pre- and post-conditions. The advantage of the state machine
approach is twofold: 1) specifying the correctness of your programs becomes less
adhoc, and 2) you get testing for race conditions for free.

The combination of state machine based model specification and property based
testing first appeard in Erlang's proprietary QuickCheck. The
`quickcheck-state-machine` library can be seen as an attempt to provide similar
functionality to Haskell's QuickCheck library.

### Example

As a first example, let's implement and test programs using mutable
references. Our implementation will be using `IORef`s, but let's start with a
representation of what actions are possible with programs using mutable
references. Our mutable references can be created, read from, written to and
incremented:

```haskell
data Command r
  = Create
  | Read      (Reference (Opaque (IORef Int)) r)
  | Write     (Reference (Opaque (IORef Int)) r) Int
  | Increment (Reference (Opaque (IORef Int)) r)

data Response r
  = Created (Reference (Opaque (IORef Int)) r)
  | ReadValue Int
  | Written
  | Incremented
```

When we generate actions we won't be able to create arbitrary `IORef`s, that's
why all uses of `IORef`s are wrapped in `Reference _ r`, where the parameter `r`
will let us use symbolic references while generating (and concrete ones when
executing).

In order to be able to show counterexamples, we need a show instance for our
actions. `IORef`s don't have a show instance, thats why we wrap them in
`Opaque`; which gives a show instance to a type that doesn't have one.

Next, we give the actual implementation of our mutable references. To make
things more interesting, we parametrise the semantics by a possible problem.

```haskell
data Bug = None | Logic | Race
  deriving Eq

semantics :: Bug -> Command Concrete -> IO (Response Concrete)
semantics bug cmd = case cmd of
  Create        -> Created     <$> (reference . Opaque <$> newIORef 0)
  Read ref      -> ReadValue   <$> readIORef  (opaque ref)
  Write ref i   -> Written     <$  writeIORef (opaque ref) i'
    where
    -- One of the problems is a bug that writes a wrong value to the
    -- reference.
      i' | i `Prelude.elem` [5..10] = if bug == Logic then i + 1 else i
         | otherwise                = i
  Increment ref -> do
    -- The other problem is that we introduce a possible race condition
    -- when incrementing.
    if bug == Race
    then do
      i <- readIORef (opaque ref)
      threadDelay =<< randomRIO (0, 5000)
      writeIORef (opaque ref) (i + 1)
    else
      atomicModifyIORef' (opaque ref) (\i -> (i + 1, ()))
    return Incremented
```

Note that above `r` is instantiated to `Concrete`, which is essentially the
identity type, so while writing the semantics we have access to real `IORef`s.

We now have an implementation, the next step is to define a model for the
implementation to be tested against. We'll use a simple map between references
and integers as a model.

```haskell
newtype Model r = Model [(Reference (Opaque (IORef Int)) r, Int)]

initModel :: Model r
initModel = Model []
```

The pre-condition of an action specifies in what context the action is
well-defined. For example, we can always create a new mutable reference, but
we can only read from references that already have been created. The
pre-conditions are used while generating programs (lists of actions).

```haskell
precondition :: Model Symbolic -> Command Symbolic -> Logic
precondition (Model m) cmd = case cmd of
  Create        -> Top
  Read  ref     -> ref `elem` map fst m
  Write ref _   -> ref `elem` map fst m
  Increment ref -> ref `elem` map fst m
```

The transition function explains how actions change the model. Note that the
transition function is polymorphic in `r`. The reason for this is that we use
the transition function both while generating and executing.

```haskell
transition :: Eq1 r => Model r -> Command r -> Response r -> Model r
transition m@(Model model) cmd resp = case (cmd, resp) of
  (Create, Created ref)        -> Model ((ref, 0) : model)
  (Read _, ReadValue _)        -> m
  (Write ref x, Written)       -> Model (update ref x model)
  (Increment ref, Incremented) -> case lookup ref model of
    Just i  -> Model (update ref (succ i) model)

update :: Eq a => a -> b -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)]
update ref i m = (ref, i) : filter ((/= ref) . fst) m
```

Post-conditions are checked after we executed an action and got access to the
result.

```haskell
postcondition :: Model Concrete -> Command Concrete -> Response Concrete -> Logic
postcondition (Model m) cmd resp = case (cmd, resp) of
  (Create,        Created ref) -> m' ! ref .== 0 .// "Create"
    where
      Model m' = transition (Model m) cmd resp
  (Read ref,      ReadValue v)  -> v .== m ! ref .// "Read"
  (Write _ref _x, Written)      -> Top
  (Increment _ref, Incremented) -> Top
```

Next we have to explain how to generate and shrink actions.

```haskell
generator :: Model Symbolic -> Maybe (Gen (Command Symbolic))
generator (Model model) = Just $ frequency
  [ (1, pure Create)
  , (4, Read  <$> elements (map fst model))
  , (4, Write <$> elements (map fst model) <*> arbitrary)
  , (4, Increment <$> elements (domain model))
  ]

shrinker :: Model Symbolic -> Command Symbolic -> [Command Symbolic]
shrinker _ (Write ref i) = [ Write ref i' | i' <- shrink i ]
shrinker _ _             = []
```

To stop the generation of new commands, e.g., when the model has reached a
terminal or error state, let `generator` return `Nothing`.

Finally, we show how to mock responses given a model.

```haskell
mock :: Model Symbolic -> Command Symbolic -> GenSym (Response Symbolic)
mock (Model m) cmd = case cmd of
  Create      -> Created   <$> genSym
  Read ref    -> ReadValue <$> pure (m ! ref)
  Write _ _   -> pure Written
  Increment _ -> pure Incremented
```

(`mock` is a hack to make it possible for responses to have multiple reference,
and an experiment which maybe one day will let us create mocked APIs. See issue
[#236](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/issues/236)
for further details.)

To be able to fit the code on a line we pack up all of them above into a
record.

```haskell
sm :: Bug -> StateMachine Model Command IO Response
sm bug = StateMachine initModel transition precondition postcondition
           Nothing generator shrinker (semantics bug) mock
```

We can now define a sequential property as follows.

```haskell
prop_sequential :: Bug -> Property
prop_sequential bug = forAllCommands sm' Nothing $ \cmds -> monadicIO $ do
  (hist, _model, res) <- runCommands sm' cmds
  prettyCommands sm' hist (checkCommandNames cmds (res === Ok))
    where
      sm' = sm bug
```

If we run the sequential property without introducing any problems to the
semantics function, i.e. `quickCheck (prop_sequential None)`, then the property
passes. If we however introduce the logic bug problem, then it will fail with the
minimal counterexample:

```
> quickCheck (prop_sequential Logic)
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 12 tests and 2 shrinks):
Commands
  { unCommands =
      [ Command Create [ Var 0 ]
      , Command (Write (Reference (Symbolic (Var 0))) 5) []
      , Command (Read (Reference (Symbolic (Var 0)))) []
      ]
  }

Model []

   == Create ==> Created (Reference (Concrete Opaque)) [ 0 ]

Model [+_×_ (Reference Opaque)
          0]

   == Write (Reference (Concrete Opaque)) 5 ==> Written [ 0 ]

Model [_×_ (Reference Opaque)
         -0
         +5]

   == Read (Reference (Concrete Opaque)) ==> ReadValue 6 [ 0 ]

Model [_×_ (Reference Opaque) 5]

PostconditionFailed "AnnotateC \"Read\" (PredicateC (6 :/= 5))" /= Ok
```

Recall that the bug problem causes the write of values ``i `elem` [5..10]`` to
actually write `i + 1`. Also notice how the diff of the model is displayed
between each action.

Running the sequential property with the race condition problem will not uncover
the race condition.

If we however define a parallel property as follows.

```haskell
prop_parallel :: Bug -> Property
prop_parallel bug = forAllParallelCommands sm' $ \cmds -> monadicIO $ do
  prettyParallelCommands cmds =<< runParallelCommands sm' cmds
    where
      sm' = sm bug
```

And run it using the race condition problem, then we'll find the race
condition:

```
> quickCheck (prop_parallel Race)
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 26 tests and 6 shrinks):
ParallelCommands
  { prefix =
      Commands { unCommands = [ Command Create [ Var 0 ] ] }
  , suffixes =
      [ Pair
          { proj1 =
              Commands
                { unCommands =
                    [ Command (Increment (Reference (Symbolic (Var 0)))) []
                    , Command (Read (Reference (Symbolic (Var 0)))) []
                    ]
                }
          , proj2 =
              Commands
                { unCommands =
                    [ Command (Increment (Reference (Symbolic (Var 0)))) []
                    ]
                }
          }
      ]
  }

AnnotateC "Read" (PredicateC (1 :/= 2))
```

As we can see above, a mutable reference is first created, and then in
parallel (concurrently) we do two increments of said reference, and finally we
read the value `1` while the model expects `2`.

Recall that incrementing is implemented by first reading the reference and
then writing it, if two such actions are interleaved then one of the writes
might end up overwriting the other one -- creating the race condition.

We shall come back to this example below, but if your are impatient you can
find the full source
code
[here](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/MemoryReference.hs).

### How it works

The rough idea is that the user of the library is asked to provide:

  * a datatype of actions;
  * a datatype model;
  * pre- and post-conditions of the actions on the model;
  * a state transition function that given a model and an action advances the
    model to its next state;
  * a way to generate and shrink actions;
  * semantics for executing the actions.

The library then gives back a bunch of combinators that let you define a
sequential and a parallel property.

#### Sequential property

The *sequential property* checks if the model is consistent with respect to the
semantics. The way this is done is:

  1. generate a list of actions;

  2. starting from the initial model, for each action do the the following:

       1. check that the pre-condition holds;
       2. if so, execute the action using the semantics;
       3. check if the the post-condition holds;
       4. advance the model using the transition function.

  3. If something goes wrong, shrink the initial list of actions and present a
     minimal counterexample.

#### Parallel property

The *parallel property* checks if parallel execution of the semantics can be
explained in terms of the sequential model. This is useful for trying to find
race conditions -- which normally can be tricky to test for. It works as
follows:

  1. generate a list of actions that will act as a sequential prefix for the
     parallel program (think of this as an initialisation bit that setups up
     some state);

  2. generate two lists of actions that will act as parallel suffixes;

  3. execute the prefix sequentially;

  4. execute the suffixes in parallel and gather the a trace (or history) of
     invocations and responses of each action;

  5. try to find a possible sequential interleaving of action invocations and
     responses that respects the post-conditions.

The last step basically tries to find
a [linearisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability) of calls that
could have happend on a single thread.

### More examples

Here are some more examples to get you started:

  * The water jug problem from *Die Hard 3* -- this is a
    simple
    [example](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/DieHard.hs) of
    a specification where we use the sequential property to find a solution
    (counterexample) to a puzzle from an action movie. Note that this example
    has no meaningful semantics, we merely model-check. It might be helpful to
    compare the solution to the
    Hedgehog
    [solution](http://clrnd.com.ar/posts/2017-04-21-the-water-jug-problem-in-hedgehog.html) and
    the
    TLA+
    [solution](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples/blob/master/specifications/DieHard/DieHard.tla);

  * Mutable
    reference
    [example](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/MemoryReference.hs) --
    this is a bigger example that shows both how the sequential property can
    find normal bugs, and how the parallel property can find race conditions;

  * Circular buffer
    [example](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/CircularBuffer.hs)
    -- another example that shows how the sequential property can find help find
    different kind of bugs. This example is borrowed from the paper *Testing the
    Hard Stuff and Staying Sane*
    [[PDF](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/232550/local_232550.pdf),
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q)];

  * Ticket
    dispenser
    [example](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/TicketDispenser.hs) --
    a simple example where the parallel property is used once again to find a
    race condition. The semantics in this example uses a simple database file
    that needs to be setup and cleaned up. This example also appears in the
    *Testing a Database for Race Conditions with QuickCheck* and *Testing the
    Hard Stuff and Staying
    Sane*
    [[PDF](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/232550/local_232550.pdf),
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q)] papers;

  * CRUD webserver where create returns unique
    ids
    [example](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/blob/master/test/CrudWebserverDb.hs) --
    create, read, update and delete users in a postgres database on a webserver
    using an API written
    using [Servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant). Creating a user
    will return a unique id, which subsequent reads, updates, and deletes need
    to use. In this example, unlike in the last one, the server is setup and
    torn down once per property rather than generate program.

All properties from the examples can be found in the
[`Spec`](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/tree/master/test/Spec.hs)
module located in the
[`test`](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine/tree/master/test)
directory. The properties from the examples get tested as part of [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine).

To get a better feel for the examples it might be helpful to `git clone` this
repo, `cd` into it, fire up `stack ghci --test`, load the different examples,
e.g. `:l test/CrudWebserverDb.hs`, and run the different properties
interactively.

### Real world examples

More examples from the "real world":

  * Adjoint's implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm, contains state
    machine
    [tests](https://github.com/adjoint-io/raft/blob/master/test/QuickCheckStateMachine.hs)
    combined with fault injection (node and network failures);

  * IOHK are using a state machine model to
    [test](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/master/ouroboros-consensus/test-storage/Test/Ouroboros/Storage/FS/StateMachine.hs)
    a mock file system that they in turn use to simulate file system errors when
    testing a blockchain database. The following blog
    [post](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2019/01/qsm-in-depth/) describes their
    tests in more detail.
