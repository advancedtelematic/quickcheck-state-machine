-- outermost list is used for all the shrinking possibilities. For example,
-- let's assume we haven't shrunk something yet, and therefore need to shrink
-- one of the commands. Let's further assume that only commands B and E can be
-- shrunk, to B1, B2 and E1, E2, E3 respectively. Then the result will look
-- something like
--

-- >     [A', B1', C', D', E' , F', G', H']   -- B shrunk to B1
-- >   , [A', B1', C', D', E' , F', G', H']   -- B shrunk to B2
-- >   , [A', B' , C', D', E1', F', G', H']   -- E shrunk to E1
-- >   , [A', B' , C', D', E2', F', G', H']   -- E shrunk to E2
-- >   , [A', B' , C', D', E3', F', G', H']   -- E shrunk to E3
-- > ]
--
-- where one of the commands has been shrunk and all commands have been
-- validated and renumbered (references updated). So, in this example, the
-- result will contain at most 5 lists; it may contain fewer, since some of
-- these lists may not be valid.
--
-- If we _did_ already shrink something, then no commands will be shrunk, and
-- the resulting list will either be empty (if the list of commands was invalid)
-- or contain a /single/ element with the validated and renumbered commands.
